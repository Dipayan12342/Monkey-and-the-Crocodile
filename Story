Ones upon a time in a forest, there lived a Monkey who resided on a berry ttree, which was on the banks of river. In the same forest forest there lived a crocodile and his wife......

One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. 

The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits as they loved them.
